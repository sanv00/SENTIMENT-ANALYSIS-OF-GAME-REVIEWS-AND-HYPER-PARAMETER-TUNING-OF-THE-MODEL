# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-GAME-REVIEWS-AND-HYPER-PARAMETER-TUNING-OF-THE-MODEL
Used Harris Hawks Optimisation for Hyper Parameter Tuning and performed Sentiment Analysis

Machine Learning models are used to perform sentiment analysis on STEAM game reviews. Neural
Networks is used be perform sentiment Analysis. Optimal Hyperparameters for training
the model are selected using the newly proposed nature inspired algorithm, Harris Hawks
Optimization Algorithm.
